## What it is

JobApply is a personal, fully-automated AI/ML job-search pipeline built for Ishani Kathuria (MS Applied AI @ Purdue Northwest, ex-AWS SDE, F-1 international student, graduating May 2027 / possibly Dec 2026). As of 2026-07-19 the primary target is **full-time new-grad AI/ML roles in the USA** (the Summer-2026 internship cycle is over); internships/co-ops stay in scope for CPT during the school year. It scrapes jobs from intern-list.com and newgrad-jobs.com, scores and filters them (AI/ML relevance, role type, recency, and **H-1B sponsorship history**), tailors a resume + cover letter per job using an LLM, and lets Ishani review everything in a React dashboard. It also drafts warm-referral and cold emails to recruiters and tracks outreach. A GitHub Actions workflow runs the scrape-score-tailor pipeline daily; a Render-hosted FastAPI server serves the dashboard.

## Architecture

1. **GHA daily workflow** → runs `main.py --source intern_list` + `main.py --source newgrad_jobs` → jobs scored + inserted into Turso DB
2. **`main.py --tailor`** → fetches JDs → LLM tailors resume + cover letter → ReportLab generates PDFs → committed to `output/resumes/`
3. **FastAPI** (`api/main.py`) → REST API for jobs, recruiters, outreach; serves `apps/web/dist` in production
4. **React dashboard** → 6 views: Dashboard, Jobs, Analytics, Outreach, Settings, JobDrawer
5. **Cold email flow** → user adds recruiter in Outreach tab → LLM drafts email → user edits → send via Gmail SMTP → status tracked in `outreach` table

## Conventions

- **All Python lives under `src/`** (src layout). Package names stay top-level — import as `from pipeline.x import y`, NOT `from src.pipeline...`. New scrapers → `src/scrapers/<source>_scraper.py` exposing `scrape() -> list[dict]`; new pipeline modules → `src/pipeline/<name>.py` (import `llm_client` for LLM calls); new API endpoints → `src/api/main.py`.
- **Tests** → `tests/test_<module>.py` (at repo root); use `pytest`; mock external calls (HTTP, SMTP, LLM) with `unittest.mock`
- **Packaging** → src-layout `pyproject.toml`; run `pip install -e .` so `uvicorn api.main:app`, pytest, and the scripts resolve packages from any CWD (CI/render/GHA all do this). Deps live in `requirements.txt` (pyproject reads them dynamically). CLI entry is `python main.py` (it bootstraps `src/` onto `sys.path`, so it also works without the install).
- **Path anchoring** → code that needs the repo root computes it from `__file__` (e.g. `api/main.py`: `ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`). `config/`, `output/`, `apps/web/dist`, and the local SQLite DB (`src/tracker/applications.db`) are all reached via `ROOT`.
- **Frontend** → lives in `apps/web/`; run via root npm scripts (`npm run dev|build`) which delegate with `--prefix apps/web`. FastAPI serves `apps/web/dist` in production.
- **Lint** → `flake8` (config in `.flake8`); pytest config in `pyproject.toml`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint + pytest + web build on push/PR. Keep the whole tracked tree flake8-clean.
- **Before coding against any library**: fetch its latest official docs — never code APIs from memory

**In progress now:** Autonomous milestone run (2026-07-19) — **M17 (sponsorship filter), M18 (new-grad retarget), M19 (timeline & reminders), and M9 (interview-prep section) all shipped.** Working through the remaining pre-pivot milestones (M8 verify, M7, M11, M10).
**Next up:** M8 (import UI — likely already built), M7 (settings persistence), M11 (health + logging), M10 (email notifications). Warm-referral outreach to ex-AWS/Google/MS/Uber contacts is timed to each company's window via the Timeline reminders. Optional: set `GMAIL_ADDRESS`/`GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` for real sends.

## Decision log

- 2026-07-19 — Interview Prep is now a full section (M9, planned) — the M17–M19 pivot is about landing more interviews; converting them is the next bottleneck (last cycle: 1 interview from 500+ apps). Upgraded the old thin "prep sheet button" stub into a dedicated dashboard section that generates + stores a tailored prep pack per interview (company/role snapshot, topics to review, behavioral/technical/system-design question banks with talking points from her real experience, questions to ask, logistics) from the JD + company + profile — grounded, never fabricated, same discipline as resume tailoring. Not built yet; planned after M17.
- 2026-07-19 — Recruiting Timeline & Reminders (M19) — for a May-2027 grad, the full-time new-grad cycle opens Aug–Oct 2026 (now) on rolling admissions, and Google's window is a tight ~2 weeks. Added a Timeline dashboard view combining a curated per-company application calendar (`config/recruiting_calendar.json`, cycle-specific + refreshable) with live open-role counts from the scraped `jobs` table, plus apply/reach-out reminders. Reach-out reminders fire on each company's application window (referrals help at application time), which revises the timing — but not the substance — of the earlier "defer warm outreach ~1 yr" decision. Curated windows are approximate (big tech is mostly rolling; hard per-req deadlines rarely publish); the live open-role counts give ground truth.
- 2026-07-19 — Strategic pivot to full-time new-grad AI/ML roles (M18) — Ishani graduates May 2027 (possibly Dec 2026); the Summer-2026 internship cycle is over, so full-time new-grad roles become the primary target. The `newgrad-jobs.com` scraper already existed, but `job_filter`'s role gate accepted only intern keywords and scored every new-grad role 0.0 — so they were scraped and silently discarded. Broadening the gate (with a seniority guard) unlocks them. Internships/co-ops kept for CPT during the school year — a re-prioritization, not a removal.
- 2026-07-19 — Added a visa-sponsorship-history filter (M17) — the biggest structural drag on the 500-application Summer-2026 cycle (2 OAs, 1 interview) was the "will you require sponsorship?" auto-reject. Scoring jobs by whether the company is a known H-1B sponsor (curated from public USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub / MyVisaJobs data) tilts the odds better than raw volume. Soft/boost-only by default (unknown companies are not zeroed, since small/new employers may still sponsor); a strict `require_known_sponsor` flag is opt-in (wired from settings.yaml through run_pipeline). Kept as an offline JSON, not a live API call, so the daily path stays fast. Matching uses token-subset (not raw substring) so "Amazon Web Services" hits "Amazon" without "Metabolic Labs" hitting "Meta".
- 2026-07-19 — Outreach keeps both warm + cold email; warm-referral outreach deferred ~1 year — Ishani is on good terms with ex-AWS colleagues (some now at Google/Microsoft/Uber) but can't start work for ~a year, so she won't reach out yet. The module already supports both warm-referral and cold prompts; timing is a manual decision, not a code change. Referrals can be re-warmed a few months before availability.
- 2026-06-22 — LinkedIn + Handshake scrapers paused; replaced by newgrad-jobs.com — LinkedIn automation is fragile and risks account bans. Can be re-enabled in GHA by removing `if: false`.
- 2026-06-22 — intern-list + newgrad scrapers rewritten from Playwright to `requests` against jobright.ai's `swan/mini-sites/list` JSON API — ~1.9s vs 30–60s per source, no browser flakiness, and CI dropped the Chromium install (whole daily path is now browserless). Risk: undocumented internal endpoint could change; mitigated by it serving anonymously and a clean fallback to the git-tagged Playwright version if needed.
- 2026-06-22 — Added cold email outreach as a core feature (M13–M16) — job boards alone are insufficient; direct recruiter outreach dramatically increases response rates for internship searches.
- 2026-06-22 — Gmail SMTP chosen over OAuth2 for email sending — app password avoids the OAuth consent screen and is simpler for a personal tool; 500 sends/day is well within outreach volume.
- 2026-06-22 — All emails require user review before send — no auto-send to avoid mistakes; the system is a composer + tracker, not a blast tool.
- 2026-06-22 — `recruiters`/`outreach` FKs are declarative only; cascade-delete enforced in `delete_recruiter()` code — local sqlite doesn't set `foreign_keys=ON` and the Turso HTTP bridge skips PRAGMAs, so DB-level enforcement would behave differently per backend. Enforcing in code keeps both identical.
- 2026-06-23 — Repo restructured toward project-planner layout: frontend moved `web/` → `apps/web/`; added root `package.json` delegator, `pyproject.toml`, `CLAUDE.md`, and a `ci.yml` (lint+test+build).
- 2026-06-23 — Moved all Python packages under `src/` (src layout) to declutter the repo root. Coordinated path fixes: `api/main.py` ROOT anchor `+1` level + tracker-DB paths → `src/tracker`; `auto_apply` ROOT `+1`; `scripts/` `sys.path`/DB paths → `src/`; the local SQLite DB moved to `src/tracker/`. `pip install -e .` added to render/GHA/CI so `uvicorn api.main:app` and `python main.py` resolve packages. Package names stayed top-level (`api`, `pipeline`, …) so imports were unchanged. Dropped the `jobapply` console script — it required root `main.py` to be importable, which fights the src layout; `python main.py` (with a `sys.path` bootstrap) is the entry instead. Verified end-to-end: imports, pytest (46), `python main.py --stats`, live server (SPA+API 200 from `apps/web/dist`), npm build.
- Earlier — LLM provider default changed from Gemini to Groq (llama-3.1-8b-instant) — Groq free tier has no daily quota; Gemini was hitting rate limits during heavy tailoring days.
- Earlier — PDFs committed to git for Render access — Render free tier has no persistent disk; committing output/ is the simplest path. Revisit if output/ exceeds 100MB.

## Glossary

- **tailoring** — LLM rewrites Ishani's resume bullets + summary to match a specific job description; output is a JSON that feeds the PDF generator
- **queued** — job status: tailored PDF generated, ready for Ishani to review and approve for application
- **approved** — job status: Ishani has reviewed and approved; next step is auto-apply or manual apply
- **cold email** — outreach to a recruiter or HR person at a company, initiated without a prior connection
- **referral ask** — outreach to a current employee at the target company, asking them to refer Ishani to the hiring team
- **Turso** — cloud-hosted SQLite-compatible database used by GHA and Render (since neither has persistent local disk); `api/turso.py` bridges the `libsql` protocol
- **Groq** — free LLM inference provider; `llama-3.1-8b-instant` is the default model
